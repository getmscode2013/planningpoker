Planning Poker (a.k.a. Scrum Poker) is a collaborative estimation technique used by Agile teams—especially in Scrum—to estimate the effort, complexity, or size of user stories.

How Planning Poker Works

Select a story
The Product Owner briefly explains a user story and its acceptance criteria.

Discuss & clarify
Team members ask questions to ensure they fully understand the work.

Choose estimation cards
Each participant privately selects a card from a predefined sequence (commonly Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …) representing their estimate.

Reveal simultaneously
Everyone turns their card over at the same time.
→ This prevents anchoring or influence from the loudest voice.

Discuss differences
If estimates vary widely, the team discusses why.
Often:

high estimators explain the risks or complexity

low estimators explain why they think it’s simpler

Revote
After the discussion, the team votes again until convergence (consensus or near-consensus) is reached.

Why Planning Poker is Useful

Reduces cognitive bias by having simultaneous votes

Encourages discussion about assumptions, risks, and unknowns

Produces more accurate estimates
